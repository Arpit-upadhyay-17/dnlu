          <h3> Understanding Dharmashastra </h3>
          <p>
          The ancient legal system was based upon the concept of supremacy of dharma.Dharma is the Sanskrit expression of the widest import. It cannot be defined but can only be explained. For instance, the word "dharma" is used to mean justice (Nyaya), what is right in a given circumstance, moral values of right, pious obligations of individuals, righteous conduct in every sphere of activity, being helpful to other living beings, giving charity to individuals in need of it or to a public cause or alms of the needy, natural qualities or characteristics or properties of living beings and things, duty and law as also constitutional law.
          <br /> <br />The position of dharma is explained in Taittiriya Upanishad that dharma constitutes the foundation of all affairs in the world. The Supreme Court in the case of A.S. Narayana Deekshitulu, AIR 1996 SC 1765 has quoted the following verse of Karnaparva (Chapter 69, verse 58) of Mahabharata:
          Dharma is for the stability of society, the maintenance of social order and the general well-being and progress of humankind. <br /> <br />

Whatever conduces to the fulfilment of these objects is dharma; i.e. definite.

In a modern-day context, The Constitution of India being the grundnorm is the Dharmashastra for every Indian. Our Constitution establishes the supremacy of law and rule of law. It shows society what we wish to achieve. It consists of Raj Dharma that the state has to follow.
